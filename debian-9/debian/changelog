  * Updates in handling documentastion:
    - upstream tarball no longer provides txt documentation, only html,
      so no longer install API.txt.gz,
    - don't install README file since it does not contain useful information,
      only installation instructions,
    - don't install compiled tests into libetpan-doc package, which is
      Architecture: all,
    - install doc/depend.dot and doc/layer.fig files.
  * Fixes suggested by lintian:

    - ${Source-Version} => ${binary:Version}

    is temporary and most likely will disappear with next upstream. So there
    is no rationale to do 'correct' autotools handling, hacky way is ok here.)

  * Add version information (>= 0.33) to libetpan1.shlibs file.
  * Add libdb4.2-dev, libssl-dev, liblockfile-dev to Depends: line of
    libetpan-dev package because libetpan-config script suggests to link
    against those libraries.
  * Thanks to Gerfried Fuchs <alfie@ist.org> for noticing the above problems
    in packaging.
  * Added 02-no-double-libdb.dpatch that avoids double inclusion of '-ldb4-2'
    in 'libetpan-config --libs' output.

libetpan (0.33-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
  * Added patch from Gerfried Fuchs <alfie@ist.org> to use liblockfile
    for locking; added liblockfile-dev to Build-Depends.
  * Tweaked ./configure call in debian/rules as Gerfried Fuchs suggested.
  * Since this package is based on released version of the library, it's
    no longer needed to run auto* tools on build, so removed them from
    Build-Depends.
  * Release tarball contains pre-built documentation, so disabled
    documentation build, and removed jade and docbook-dsssl from Build-Depends.
  * Removed manual calls to install-docs from debian/libetpan-doc.{postinst,
    prerm} because debhelper adds those automatically.

  * New upstream CVS snapshot.
  * All my patches seem to be included upstream, so remove them.
