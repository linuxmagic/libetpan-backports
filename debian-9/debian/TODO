Here are some items that should be done for this package.

*) Discuss in -devel the trick used to provide libdb-dev dependency
   for the -dev package

*) Once lenny becomes stable, stop providing -V option for dh_makeshlibs.

*) For upgrading Standards-Version to 3.8.0:

   - "Standardized the format of DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS ..." - find out if any
     changes needed
   - "Clarify which files should go ..." - find out if any changes needed

*) Add support for nostrip (or ensure it is not needed)

*) Do something with these:
   dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: dependency on libgcc_s.so.1 could be avoided if "debian/libetpan13/usr/lib/libetpan.so.13.1.1" were not uselessly linked against it (they use none of its symbols).
   dpkg-shlibdeps: warning: dependency on libstdc++.so.6 could be avoided if "debian/libetpan13/usr/lib/libetpan.so.13.1.1" were not uselessly linked against it (they use none of its symbols).
